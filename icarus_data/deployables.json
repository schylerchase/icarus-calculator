      "description": "The Composite Dropship Recall Beacon will fire a flare that calls the Prospectors dropship to that location when thrown, which can either be used for immediate extraction or left there for use later on. Multiple Recall Beacons can be used per session, however, these are one-use items, so use them carefully. Items stored in the dropships inventory will not be lost when the dropship is called, allowing Prospectors to transport equipment/resources over large distances.",

All Landmines can be picked up and disarmed, regardless of their current state. Press and hold X to pickup and disarm Landmines. Note: once triggered, Makeshift Landmines will detonate if a Prospector/animal (excluding mounts) is nearby. They can be picked up and disarmed, but Prospectors run the risk of detonating the Landmine.",
