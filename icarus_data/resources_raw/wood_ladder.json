  "description": "Stronger than Thatch, wood buildings are a good starting point for Prospectors wanting to establish a 'Main Base'. While still flammable, they are able to fully withstand most light storms and offer good protection to Deployables and Storage containers. Wood Ladders can be use with Trapdoor holes (hold R while holding a floor building piece and select the Trapdoor variant from the radial wheel). Does not snap to trapdoor holes.",
