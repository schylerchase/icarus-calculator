  "description": "The Stone Pile, alongside theWood Pile, are makeshift storage options for large quantities of each raw material. The Stone Pile is immune to ALLWeatherdamage and can be used as a durable barrier toFauna, especially against Fauna like theGrizzly Bear. If placed with just a narrow opening between piles, Bears have an incredibly difficult time getting through which allows the Prospector to melee attack just beyond the bear's attack range.",
