  "description": "Want to turn that forest filled with bears into an inferno? The fire arrow is your friend. Need a light at the top of that cave? Fire arrow. While not as bright as the Flare Arrow , it will continue burning upon impact. Similar to the Poison Arrow , the Fire Arrow is a DOT upgrade to the Stone Arrow , which is helpful when in a 'fire and flee' situation. These arrows cannot be recovered once fired.",
