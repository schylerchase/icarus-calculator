  "description": "9mm Armor Piercing Rounds are used by thePistol. Unlike arrows, javelins, and bolts this ammunition is destroyed on impact and cannot be recovered. Unlike standard ammunition, the 9mm Armor Piercing Round can pierce hardened points and will deal 100 damage, similar to hitting a non-hardened point.",
