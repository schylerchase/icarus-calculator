  "description": "The Caveworm Arrow is ammunition used with a Bow . Like bolts and javelins, they may be recovered after being fired into the ground or an animal carcass. Similar to the Poison Arrow , these are helpful in a 'fire and flee' situation. Firing multiple arrows will continue to stack the Poisoned debuff, dealing damage over time.",
