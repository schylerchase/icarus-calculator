All Landmines can be picked up and disarmed, regardless of their current state. Press and hold X to pickup and disarm Landmines.Note:once triggered, Makeshift Landmines will detonate if a Prospector/animal (excluding mounts) is nearby. They can be picked up and disarmed, but Prospectors run the risk of detonating the Landmine.",
