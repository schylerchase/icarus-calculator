  "description": "Locates caves with audible beeping. While the cave scanner is equipped and in hand the scanner's lights will blink and it will beep so long as a cave is somewhat nearby. The frequency of blinking/beeping increases as the Prospector approaches a cave. Furthermore, the scanner will beep more rapidly if the Prospector is looking in the direction of a cave.",
