  "description": "The Composite Javelin is a variant of the Composite Spear that can only be thrown and is the highest damage dealing Javelin currently available. Despite the heavy tech investment to reach Composites , Composite Javelins are far cheaper to craft than the Titanium Javelin and are worth the investment for the increased damage and low projectile break chance.",
