  "description": "The Tackle Box is a storage deployable that can be used to store a handful of lures and caught fish. Unlike other storage deployables, the Tackle Box can be picked up with items inside and does not require shelter to be used. With 3 slots for Lures and 2 slots that will halt the spoil timer of any caught fish, the Tackle Box is a handy tool for fishing adventures.",
