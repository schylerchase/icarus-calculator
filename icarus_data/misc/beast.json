  "description": "While holding the BEAST, Prospectors can left-click while looking at an animal to \"scan\" that animal (must be close to the target to initiate a scan). Unlike what the description says, the scanned animal will take additional damage until another scan is performed. Scanning animals using the BEAST also grants 3 bestiary points for the animal scanned.",
