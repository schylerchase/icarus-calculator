  "description": "Thatch building pieces are very light-weight and are best used for emergency shelters, or as scaffolding inside caves. While subject to damage from milder storms than any other material, they are light enough to carry and will still offer protection to Deployables and Storage containers. For different variants, hold R while holding Thatch Halfpitches (more item actions can be seen bottom right).",
