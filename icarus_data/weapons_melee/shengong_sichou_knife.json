  "description": "This knife and others, such as the Shengong 'Qie' Knife , with the additional attribute that gives increased skinning yield actually has a 230% Yield from Skinning. This is because the additional attribute is multiplicative and not additive, making them better than the Titanium Knife or Inaris \"Ventura\" Knife at skinning. Unlike Throwing Knives , the Shengong 'Sichou' Knife cannot be thrown. There currently are no Workshop throwing knives.",
