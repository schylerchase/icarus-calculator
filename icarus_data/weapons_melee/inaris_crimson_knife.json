  "description": "The Inaris \"Crimson\" Knife is a Workshop Knife geared towards combat, intrinsically dealing fire damage to targets. Though the elemental damage does not scale with Knife talents, the debuff applied to targets can prove useful in certain situations. Despite what the flavor text says, the Inaris \"Crimson\" Knife cannot be thrown. There currently are no workshopThrowing Knives.",
