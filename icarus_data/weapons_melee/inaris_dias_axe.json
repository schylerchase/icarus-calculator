  "description": "The Inaris \"Dias\" Axe is the Workshop equivalent of an Steel Axe , allowing Prospectors to fell trees faster while also increasing the amount received from felling trees. Unlike other Axes , the Inaris \"Dias\" Axe is the only Axe that lowers the carry weight of wood by 50% when equipped, making it a valuable tool when transporting wood when paired with the Gatherer's Backpack .",
