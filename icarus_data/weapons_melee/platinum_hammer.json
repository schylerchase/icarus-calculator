In order to do so, the Prospector must have the building pieces in their inventory prior to upgrading. To select the building material, hold R while the Hammer is equipped and select a material from the radial wheel. Once the material is selected, right clicking on a building piece will upgrade it to the selected material if the building piece is currently in the Prospectors inventory.",
