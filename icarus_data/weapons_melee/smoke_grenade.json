Upon detonation, the Smoke Grenade will cover the area in smoke and will obstruct the vision of creatures within the smoke. However, it will not stop creatures that are already aggressively pursuing Prospectors, creatures spawned by Thumpers, Radars, or other mission items that have been placed or activated.
