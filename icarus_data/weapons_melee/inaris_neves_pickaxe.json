  "description": "The Inaris \"Neves\" Pickaxe is the Workshop equivalent of aTitanium Pickaxe, allowing Prospectors to mine higher tier metals (Aluminium Ore,Platinum Ore, etc) at earlier stages of a Prospect while greatly increasing yield.\nUnlike other pickaxes, the Inaris \"Neves\" Pickaxe is the only pickaxe that reduces the over-encumbrance penalty by 50% when equipped, which makes mobility while over-encumbered bearable when paired with the talentCarry OnandMass Dampener Modules.",
