  "description": "The Anvil Bench is unlocked near the start of the Tier 2 Tech Tree . It enables the Prospector to craft higher quality tools such as the Iron Pickaxe and Steel Pickaxe . It is also where these tools can be repaired. While it can be placed with no shelter, it would be unusable. Will take damage if left without shelter (or under a severely damaged roof) in storms.",
