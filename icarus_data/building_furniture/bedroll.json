  "description": "The Bedroll allows prospectors to sleep provided it is sufficiently sheltered, a campfire/heater/dehumidifier/etc is nearby, and it is night time in-game. In a multiplayer game, all prospectors must sleep at the same time to pass the night. Sleeping will provide the Well RestedStatus Effect. Prospectors can set their respawn location to a bedroll, however if this bedroll is picked up or destroyed, the prospector's spawn location will reset back to their drop pod.",
