  "description": "The Salting Station is an early-game cooking bench that provides a way to for Prospectors to preserve foods using Salt . Once a food is salted, it will receive the Preserved modifier, increasing spoil time by 100%. Salting a food item will reset its spoil timer, even if the item is nearly spoiled. This technique can be used to further extend the spoilage.",
