  "description": "The Art Deco Bed allows prospectors to sleep provided it is sufficiently sheltered and it is night time in-game.  In a multiplayer game, all prospectors must sleep at the same time to pass the night. Prospectors can set their respawn location to a bed, however if this bed is deconstructed or destroyed, the prospector's spawn location will reset back to the drop-pod. The Art Deco Bed has the best sleep quality of any bed.",
