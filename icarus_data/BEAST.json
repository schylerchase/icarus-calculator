Unlike what the description says, the scanned animal will take additional damage until another scan is performed. Scanning animals using the BEAST also grants 3 bestiary points for the animal scanned. The BEAST is unlocked in the Workshop on the Space Station and is equipped in the Prospector's loadout before starting a new prospect.\",\"image\":\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/icarus/images/e/e6/Site-logo.png/revision/latest?cb=20230901084403\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/icarus/images/e/e6/Site-logo.png/revision/latest?cb=20230901084403\"}",
