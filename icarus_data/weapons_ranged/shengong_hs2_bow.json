  "description": "The Shengong HS2 Bow is a stronger variant of the Shengong Bows using arrows and talents interchangeably with other bows. Despite the Shengong HS2 Bow dealing 35% less damage than the Larkwell Martinez Compound Bow , the Shengong HS2 Bow is unmatched in reload speed and fire rate; perfect for the Prospector who wants to fill the skies with arrows.",
