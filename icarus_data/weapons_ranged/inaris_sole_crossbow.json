  "description": "Using arrows and talents interchangeably with other crossbows, the Inaris \"Sole\" Crossbow is geared more towards elemental damage. When paired withBoltsthat deal elemental damage (Obsidian Bolts,Larkwell Martinez Charged Bolts, etc), the Inaris \"Sole\" Crossbow can pack a punch, making it a decent, if not expensive, upgrade to the previous Workshop Crossbows. Dealt elemental damage is not affected by Crossbow talents.",
