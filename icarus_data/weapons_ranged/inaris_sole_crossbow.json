  "description": "Using arrows and talents interchangeably with other crossbows, the Inaris \"Sole\" Crossbow is geared more towards elemental damage. When paired with Bolts that deal elemental damage ( Obsidian Bolts , Larkwell Martinez Charged Bolts , etc), the Inaris \"Sole\" Crossbow can pack a punch, making it a decent, if not expensive, upgrade to the previous Workshop Crossbows. Dealt elemental damage is not affected by Crossbow talents.",
