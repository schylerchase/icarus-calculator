  "description": "This module increases resistance to fall damage by 40% when equipped in an Envirosuit module slot, reducing the amount of damage received when falling. It can be researched and crafted on the Space Station in the Workshop . Multiple KickFall Modules may be equipped if the Prospector has available slots on their Envirosuit. The resistance increase from each KickFall Module will stack and will grant near immunity to fall damage if four are equipped. Falling resistance now caps at 99%.",
